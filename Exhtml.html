	<p align="justify"><strong>Airbnb</strong> is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term lodging including vacation rentals, apartment rentals, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms. The company does not own any lodging; it is merely a broker and receives percentage service fees (commissions) from both guests and hosts in conjunction with every booking.It has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries,and the cost of lodging is set by the host.</p>
	<h2 style="color:red">How it works</h2>
		<p align="justify">Airbnb can be accessed via either the Airbnb websites or mobile applications for iOS, Apple Watch, and Android. Registration and account creation is free.On each booking, the company charges guests a 6%-12% guest services fee and charges hosts a 3%-5% host service fee. Hosts can also offer "experiences", such as excursions, to guests for an additional charge, of which Airbnb takes 20% as a commission.Users can search for lodging using a variety of filters including lodging type, dates, location, and price. Before booking, users must provide a valid name, email address, telephone number, photo, payment information, and, if required by the host, a scan of a government-issued ID. Guests also are required to agree to any house rules of the host.</p>
	<h3 style="color:blue">Offering lodging</h3>
		<p align="justify">Users can create a listing by selecting the "Host" menu after logging in. A listing will not go live until the host is ready to publish. Pricing is determined by the host, with recommendations from Airbnb. Hosts can charge different prices for nightly, weekly, and monthly stays and can make adjustments for seasonal pricing. Hosts add descriptions of the residence, amenities, available dates, cancellation policies, and any house rules and hosts are advised to upload photos of the lodging that is offered. For eligible hosts, Airbnb offers free professional photography. Potential guests are required to message the host directly through Airbnb to ask questions regarding the property. Unless the host has enabled "instant book", in which case requests for stays are accepted automatically, a host has 24 hours to accept or decline a booking. After the reservation, hosts coordinate meeting times and contact information with guests.</p>
	<h3 style="color:blue">Safety mechanisms</h3>
		<p align="justify">Airbnb had to overcome the obstacle of "stranger danger" to build a level of trust between hosts and guests and instill confidence in its platform. Airbnb did this by requiring user profiles so that members can learn about their hosts and guests ahead of time and by establishing a rating and review system. Founder Joe Gebbia has said that Airbnb is specifically "designed for trust".</p>
	<h4>References and reviews</h4>
		<p align="justify">After the guest completes a stay, the host and guest have the option of leaving references for each other and reviews of their stay, which are posted publicly, providing for an online reputation.</p>
	<h4>Insurance</h4>
		<p align="justify">Airbnb recommends that hosts obtain insurance which covers damages caused by guests. Airbnb offers secondary insurance, called its "host guarantee". This guarantee covers property loss and damage due to vandalism and theft. When first launched in August 2011, the program covered up to US$50,000. However, the maximum was later increased to US$1,000,000. The company also has a 24-hour customer service hotline and a task force to review suspicious activity.</p>
	<h4>Logged private messaging system</h4>
		<p align="justify">The site provides a private messaging system as a channel for users to message one another privately before booking and accepting reservations.[</p>
	<h4>Decline or cancellation of reservations</h4>
		<p align="justify">Hosts are able to decline reservations if they are not comfortable with the guest, based on online correspondence, and cancel reservations, albeit with a penalty.</p>
	<h4>Secure payments</h4>
		<p align="justify">Airbnb facilitates online payments from guest to host through its Security Payments feature, which processes payment transactions 24 hours after check-in.</p>
	<h4>Security deposits and cleaning fees</h4>
		<p align="justify">At the option of the host, Airbnb facilitates security deposits and mandatory non-refundable cleaning fees, the former of which is held until the property is vacated.</p>
	<h4>Verification of identity</h4>
		<p align="justify">Any Airbnb host can require their prospective guests to obtain "Verified IDs" before booking, meaning that they are required to scan a government-issued ID to verify their identity.</p>
	<h4>Linking to social network accounts</h4>
		<p align="justify">An Airbnb account can be linked to accounts on social networking services such as Facebook, thus providing the host with data on common friends and interests.</p>
	<h3 style="color:blue">Wish list feature</h3>
		<p align="justify">In June 2012, Airbnb launched a wish list feature, offering users the ability to create a curated catalog of desired lodgings that they would like to visit. Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer, Joe Gebbia and his team conceived the idea of changing the website from an online marketplace to a source for inspiration. Users can organise their favorite destinations into organized lists and share these lists with other users.</p>
	<h3 style="color:blue">Neighborhoods travel guide</h3>
		<p align="justify">"Neighborhoods" is a travel guide that provides in-depth information for selected neighborhoods in 23 major cities through photos, essays, maps, tags from locals, and assessments of various criteria that would be of interest to guests such as public transportation, dining, peace & quiet, nightlife, tourist attractions, and shopping, thereby helping travelers choose the ideal neighborhood to stay in via collaborative filtering. The Airbnb product team hand-mapped hundreds of neighborhoods within these 23 cities and had local editors curate content for each neighborhood. Airbnb also added 70 street photographers who generated 40,000 photographs for the project.</p>
